          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Identity</b></h5>
          <p>Assassin's True Name is Semiramis (セミラミス, Semiramisu?), Wise Queen of Assyria (アッシリアの賢女王, Asshiria no Ken-Joō?). Born from the Syrian mermaid goddess Derketo and a human man, she was left on the waterfront by her loveless mother. She was wrapped in the warm wings of a dove, and fed with the dove's milk. Semiramis was then found and educated by the shepherd Simmas until she married Onnes, an old general; but she was then taken away by the Syrian king Ninus who fell in love with her thanks to her beautiful face. This forced Onnes to commit suicide, and after Semiramis earned the favors of the king with original battle plans, she married him and formally became queen. A few days after the marriage, she killed the king with poison, and reigned as a regent over Assyria for the next few decades. This is the oldest case of murder by poisoning in legends.</p>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>Semiramis was born between the Goddess Derketo and a human, and ashamed of that fact, Derketo abandoned her by the water's side. 
But as a baby carrying the blood of the god, she was brought up by countless doves and given a new lease on life. 
Growing up beautifully, Semiramis was wed to the aging general Onnes, but the ambitious King Ninus captivated by her face half-forcefully parted her from her husband. Led to sorrow, Onnes committed suicide, and Semiramis was left with no choice but for her body to accept the King's grace.
When the novel tactics Semiramis suggested in a war with foreign lands landed them a victory, King Ninus came to know of her splendid talent, finally deciding a formal marriage with her.
But the moment King Ninus put his lips to his wine glass at the wedding banquet, he suddenly collapsed in pain and died. It is rumored that she laced it with poison to take revenge for her late husband. 
And thus having become Empress of Assyria, Semiramis took over the duties of managing governmental affairs for many decades, spearheading numerous expeditions and construction projects.
Afterwards, it's been said she was murdered by her son, or perhaps after handing off power she became a dove and flew away.</p>
