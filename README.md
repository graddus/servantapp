# FGOServantLibrary
A simple web application that showcases the several Servants of the Fate/Grand Order universe. The app also contains detailed information on every Servant showcased.

## Tools
The application uses a front-end that utilizes CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript. The application also uses a Java backend that communicates with a Java Database (Although because this is mostly a 'showcase' app it gets its data from a hardcoded ServiceProvider for now). The front-end communicates with the backend through REST calls.
